#SFML-Test-Project
=================

So this was a small project I decided to do over this summer to practice game programming.

##What it includes:

* Game Programming using the SFML Framework
* A good example of a basic Entity structure
* Using an ObjectManager to handle memory leaks easily
* Very buggy Collision Handling ;D
* PONG! It is 2-player game with interesting mechanics!

##As always, if you have any questions feel free to email me at superiorjt@gmail.com!
